    <p>I am afirst year student of the Bachelor in Business Administration at <a href="https://www.essec.edu/en/" target="_blank">ESSEC Business School</p>
        <p></a>I always try to give the best of myself to reach my goals.
Versatility, organization and determination are my main skills. I am able to adapt to all fields.

More and more, I am discovering an affection for communication, advertising and marketing. It would be great for me to find an internship in one of these fields which correspond to me and in which I see my future profession. 
Thanks to ESSEC's associative life, I have been able to have a little experience of what communication consists of via social medias. I would really appreciate to develop this experience on a larger scale during an internship in a company.</a>"

<p>
  I am passionate about <strong>Mode</strong>
Fashion is what I am most passionate about in the world. I think it's rare in life to find something you're so passionate about, something that makes you want to wake up in the morning and work hard to achieve your goals. Fashion is that for me.

I remember as a little girl I used to love it when my parents told me we were going to the mall. I loved walking from shop to shop and looking at all the sparkling windows, the beautiful pumps and handbags, even if I couldn't afford them. I loved to imagine outfits and draw them in my little notebooks. I may not have been the best designer by any means, but I knew I loved fashion. The desire to create was always there.

Looking back, I regret very much that I didn't have the courage to study fashion. But at the time, I wasn't yet sure who I wanted to be, I was interested in a thousand and one things and it was hard for me to settle on one field. So, like many people, I went into the humanities at CÃ©gep, because it opened more doors.

I never stopped looking for experiences here and there in fashion, because deep down, that's what really made me tick. That's what filled my eyes with stars and made me smile just thinking about it.

<p>
  I really like <strong>Skiing</strong>
Since I was young, I loved the snow. I would put on lots of clothes to stay warm and travel outdoors and have lots of adventures. As I got older, I realized that I could channel this love into my daily life. I started skiing with my dad and my favourite thing to do was to go into the woods and get lost for hours in the snow. I got a little older and started to enjoy racing. That's when I decided to go to SMS. Skiing is a way for me to go and enjoy the snow every day. Whether I am skiing the race or just skiing, I am happy. Sport brings me a lot of joy. Also, sport allows me to make new friends, travel the world and do what I love every day!

<p>
My favorite color is <strong>BLUE</strong>.
Blue can therefore be used in an infinite number of ways: if cyan blue is a primary colour, sky blue allows you to create a very airy atmosphere, night blue allows you to imagine a starry sky, ultramarine blue allows you to plunge into the infinity of the ocean, while royal blue designates shades ranging from a slightly dull dark blue to a deeper blue tending towards green, such as sky blue or gentian blue. This is why blue is and will remain my favourite colour.
